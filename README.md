### Installation

Requirements for installing the backend and for following the backend installation guide:

2. `Visual Studio Code` installation with `"Dev Containers"` and `"Docker"` extensions.

To play locally hosted multiplayer, you have to do the following steps:
1. Clone the project's development environment repository `"SpeedokuRoyaleServerDE"` from *insert linke here*
2. Clone the project's server repository `"SpeedokuRoyaleServer"` from *insert linke here* into the `"server"` folder inside the `SpeedokuRoyaleServerDE` repository.
3. Follow the installation guide in the `README.md` in the `SpeedokuRoyaleServerDE` repository to install the server and database.
4. After you have the backend installed and the server running, if you have problems connecting to the server in game (registering/logging in fails etc.) make sure that the `"baseUrl"` field's value in the `Assets/server-settings.json` file in the `SpeedokuRoyale` repository is the same as the server's base URL.
